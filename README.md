# Utils

The `utils` folder contains reusable modules for common tasks across the project, improving code organization and reducing redundancy. These modules encapsulate frequently used functions and classes, streamlining processes like data loading, preparation, and transformation.

## Key Components

- **Loader**: Handles the initial data preparation and loading, making the data accessible for various tasks throughout the project. This module serves as a foundation for multiple processes, ensuring data is consistently preprocessed and ready for use.

Each class and function within this folder is documented to specify its purpose and usage. Please refer to the individual documentation within each module for detailed information on parameters, methods, and examples of usage.
